### Strings
- Set of Characters
- Sequence of characters
- Strings are immutable
- any sequence of characters either with in single or double quotes
- A data type that stores a sequence of elements in character form.
- String Slicing
    - Indexing was only limited to accessing a single element, Slicing on the other hand is accessing a sequence of data inside the string.
- String Methods

***Data Structures***
- Data structures refer to the collection or group of data in a particular structure.

## List

Lists are the most commonly used data structure. Think of it as a sequence of data that is enclosed in square brackets and data are separated by a comma. Each of these data can be accessed by calling it's index value.

Lists are declared by just equating a variable to '[ ]' or list. We can use lists to hold an ordered sequence of values.

It holds different types of variables in the same list

Lists are mutable, their contents can change as more statements are interpreted.
 
### Methods

| Method Name | Use | Explanation |
|----|---|--|
| append | alist.append(item) | Adds a new item to the end of a list |
| insert	| alist.insert(i,item) |	Inserts an item at the ith position in a list |
|pop	|alist.pop()	|Removes and returns the last item in a list|
|sort|	alist.sort()|	Modifies a list to be sorted|
|reverse|	alist.reverse()|	Modifies a list to be in reverse order|
|del|	del alist[i]|	Deletes the item in the ith position|
|index|	alist.index(item)|	Returns the index of the first occurrence of item|
|count|	alist.count(item)|	Returns the number of occurrences of item|
|remove|	alist.remove(item)|	Removes the first occurrence of item|
