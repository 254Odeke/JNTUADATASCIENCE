    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python discovered by Guido Van Russom in 1994with version 1\n",
    "* Version 2 is introduced in 2000\n",
    "* Version 3 is introduced in 2008\n",
    "* Version 3.8 is introduced in 2019\n",
    "* Python is intrepreted language.That means the compiling is done by the python programming without any separate source.So,that the code is executed line by line.\n",
    "* It is high level language means the code can be understandable by a human.\n",
    "* Python general purpose language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The programming in python is very easy to learn and develope.\n",
    "* It Supports Object oriented programming(OOPs)\n",
    "* It is platform independent.\n",
    "* It is having more number of advanced libraries.\n",
    "* Python is open source and having a huge developer community.\n",
    "* Used to develope web applications,Machine learning algorithms,Data science,IoT devices and Artificial Intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is very easy to use.\n",
    "* Python is just like English language,so that easy to understand.\n",
    "* Code will be executed line by line.\n",
    "* Time will be saved due to line by line.\n",
    "* All advanced technologies are using this python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idles for Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic Idles like Original Idle of python,sublimetext,pycharm,notepad++,visuial studio etc.\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "* Google colab\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Only Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "* By default all libraries are installed.\n",
    "* For using the text and code at the same place we can use jupyter notebook\n",
    "* Jupyter supports all the advanced programming.\n",
    "* Most of the MNC's are using Jupyter as their Idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The programming used in Jupyter Notebook is called as Literature Programming.\n",
    "* The text we are using is called as Markdown\n",
    "* Converting a cell into markdown cell--- esc + m\n",
    "* converting a cell into code cell -- esc + y\n",
    "* Running the cell ---- Shift + enter\n",
    "* To run and insert a cell below --- alt + enter\n",
